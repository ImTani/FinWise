### **FinWise: AI-Powered Financial Data Consultant**

FinWise is an advanced AI-driven financial consultant designed to streamline and transform how financial data is retrieved, organized, and analyzed. At its core, FinWise tackles the inefficiencies financial professionals face when extracting and managing information from complex documents like annual reports. By utilizing a cutting-edge **Knowledge-Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG)** system, FinWise dynamically builds and updates a knowledge graph, enabling intelligent query-based retrieval across multiple documents. This empowers users to ask natural language questions and receive precise, context-aware financial insights.

FinWise integrates several key components:

- **Neo4j** as a powerful graph database to manage interconnected financial data and relationships.
- **OpenAI's Language Learning Model (LLM)** for robust natural language processing (NLP) and generating insightful responses based on user queries.
- **GaiaNet architecture**, which enables scalable model deployment, offering access to both public LLMs and private fine-tuned models hosted locally.

The system supports a rich feature set:
- **NLP-based entity and intent extraction**, enabling users to ask natural language questions about companies, financial metrics, trends, and comparisons.
- **Cypher query generation and validation**, dynamically pulling relevant data from the Neo4j database.
- **Context-aware conversation management**, ensuring coherent, multi-step interactions where the system remembers key elements from previous exchanges.
- **Graph and table conversions**, allowing users to convert static financial data into dynamic, customizable graphs via automatically generated HTML or Next.js code.

FinWise is designed with scalability and ease of use in mind, targeting financial professionals and large corporations that need efficient, reliable solutions for managing complex data. By offering the ability to manage and visualize financial information seamlessly, FinWise reduces manual efforts in data extraction, formatting, and conversion, significantly enhancing productivity. Additionally, it handles global data format variations, such as international and Indian numbering conventions, allowing for smoother global financial analysis.

The system doesnâ€™t just answer queries; it helps users present data in a meaningful way, whether by providing tailored insights, generating dynamic graphs, or adapting to diverse formats. FinWise aims to transform the way financial consultants and corporations manage their data, making the process faster, smarter, and more intuitive.
